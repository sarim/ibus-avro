# Contributing

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project. Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:

- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)

## Get Involved

There are many ways to contribute to this project. Here's a few ideas to get started:

- Simply start using Avro phonetic. Go through the installation guideline. Does everything work as expected? If not, we're always looking for improvements. Let us know by [opening an issue](#issues).
- Look through the [open issues](https://github.com/sarim/ibus-avro/issues). Provide workarounds, ask for clarification, or suggest labels.
- If you find an issue you would like to fix, open a pull request. Issues tagged as **Good first issue** are a good place to get started.
- Read through the [Readme](https://github.com/sarim/ibus-avro/blob/master/README.md). If you find anything that is confusing or can be improved, you can click "Edit this page" which takes you to the GitHub interface to make and propose changes.

### Triaging Issues and Pull Requests

One great way you can contribute to a project without writing any code is to help triage issues and pull requests as they come in.

- Ask for more information if you believe the issue does not provide all the details required to solve it.
- Suggest **labels** that can help categorize issues.
- Flag issues that are stale or that should be closed.
- Ask for test plans and review code.

## Issues

When [opening a new issue](https://github.com/sarim/ibus-avro/issues/new), always make sure to fill out the issue template. **This step is very important!** Not doing so may result in your issue not being managed in a timely fashion. Don't take this personally if this happens, and feel free to open a new issue once you've gathered all the information required by the template.

### Bugs

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sarim/ibus-avro/issues) for our public bugs. If you would like to report a problem, take a look around and see if someone already opened an issue about it. If you are certain this is a new, unreported bug, you can submit a [bug report](https://github.com/sarim/ibus-avro/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2Cstatus%3A+needs+triage&template=bug.yml).

- **One issue, one bug:** Please report a single bug per issue.
- **Provide reproduction steps:** List all the steps necessary to reproduce the issue. The person reading your bug report should be able to follow these steps to reproduce your issue with minimal effort.

If you're only fixing a bug, it's fine to submit a pull request right away but we still recommend filing an issue detailing what you're fixing. This is helpful in case we don't accept that specific fix but want to keep track of the issue.

### Feature requests

If you would like to request a new feature or enhancement but are not yet thinking about opening a pull request, you can file an issue with the [feature template](https://github.com/sarim/ibus-avro/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature%2Cstatus%3A+needs+triage&template=feature.yml).

### Proposals

If you intend to make any non-trivial changes to existing implementations, we recommend filing an issue with the [proposal template](https://github.com/sarim/ibus-avro/issues/new?assignees=&labels=proposal%2Cstatus%3A+needs+triage&template=proposal.yml).

## Pull Requests

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free video series:

[**How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub**](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

Please make sure the following is done when submitting a pull request:

1. **Keep your PR small.** Small pull requests (~300 lines of diff) are much easier to review and more likely to get merged. Make sure the PR does only one thing, otherwise please split it.
2. **Use descriptive titles.** It is recommended to follow this [commit message style](#semantic-commit-messages).
3. **Test your changes.** Describe your [**test plan**](#test-plan) in your pull request description.
